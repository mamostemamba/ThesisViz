## 📖 What is ThesisViz?

ThesisViz is an app designed to make academic diagram creation simple. Instead of learning complex drawing tools or coding, you just describe what you need in plain language. The app uses AI to generate diagrams that fit your description.

You can get diagrams in popular formats used in academic work:

- **TikZ**: for LaTeX documents
- **Matplotlib**: for Python plotting
- **Mermaid**: for flowcharts and diagrams

This saves you time and helps you focus on writing your thesis instead of struggling with graphics.

## 🚀 Getting Started: How ThesisViz Works

ThesisViz works in three simple steps:

1. **Describe your diagram**  
   Write a clear and simple description of what you want your diagram to look like. For example, "a flowchart showing the thesis writing process with five steps."

2. **Choose output format**  
   Pick one of the supported formats: TikZ, Matplotlib, or Mermaid. You can select the one best suited for your thesis or software you use.

3. **Download and use the diagram**  
   ThesisViz generates code or an image you can insert directly into your thesis document.

You do not need to code or draw manually. The AI handles the technical work.

## 💡 Tips for Good Diagram Descriptions

To get the best results, keep these tips in mind:

- Use simple and clear language. For example:  
  - “Draw a timeline with four events from thesis proposal to defense”  
  - “Create a flowchart showing three stages: research, writing, review”  
- Mention shapes if important (circles, rectangles, arrows).  
- Specify the order or layout if that matters.  
- Avoid very complex instructions in one go; break them into smaller parts if needed.  

If the result is not exactly what you want, try rephrasing the description or change the format.
